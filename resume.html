        <em>Education</em>
        <br>Before I moved to Medfield, Massachusetts, I went to a Pre-K through 8th grade school in Saratoga, California. I attended that school for all years. It was also a Catholic private school. I only got under a 3.5 GPA for one trimester of middle school. I have also g>otten a very high percentile on my High School Placement Test, accepting me into 3 different high tier high schools before moving to Massachusetts.

        <em>Volunteer Experience</em>
        <br>I have a lot of volunteer experience. My best feat of service work is running for Cystic Fibrosis for charity to give to the Elizabeth Nash Foundation. The ENF is a foundation to help those with Cystic Fibrosis. I have raised over forty thousand dollars after doing this project multiple times. I've also done project in elementary and middle school. We would go to homes and schools in need and take care for them. I've done enough service work to get a $300 scholarship for it.

        <em>Extra Curricular Activities</em>
        <br>From middle school to high school, I've done quite a bit of extracurricular and after-school activities. In middle school, I did: 
        <ul>Two years of competitive robotics and went to the world championships both times. </ul>
        <ul>Basketball and volleyball as middle school sports for three years. </ul>
        <ul>I have been playing organized tennis for only one year, but I am picking it up quickly.</ul> 
        <ul>For freshman year of high school, I did cross-country and track. </ul>
