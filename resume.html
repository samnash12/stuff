        <em>Volunteer Experience</em>
        <br>I have a lot of volunteer experience. My best feat of service work is running for Cystic Fibrosis for charity. I've raised over $30,000 for Cystic Fibrosis and helped give 13 scholarships. (List more)

        <em>Extra Curricular Activities</em>
        <br>From middle school to high school, I've done quite a bit of extracurricular and after-school activities. In middle school, I did two years of competitive robotics and went to the world championships both times. I've also done basketball and volleyball as middle school sports for three years.
